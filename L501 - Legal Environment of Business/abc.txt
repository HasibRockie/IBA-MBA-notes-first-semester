\notesection{Proposal, Offer, Promise, Acceptance – Definitions, Differences \& Revocation}{24-04-25 Thursday}

\textbf{1. Proposal (Offer):}  
According to Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872,  
\textit{“When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other, he is said to make a proposal.”}  

In business law, "proposal" and "offer" are often used interchangeably. A valid proposal must be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Communicated to the offeree.
    \item Made with intent to create legal relations.
    \item Definite and certain in terms.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Promise:}  
As per Section 2(b), a proposal when accepted becomes a promise.  
\textit{“When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when accepted becomes a promise.”}  

Thus, \textbf{Promise = Proposal + Acceptance}

\textbf{3. Acceptance:}  
Acceptance must be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute and unqualified.
    \item Communicated by authorized means.
    \item Given within a reasonable time or stipulated time.
\end{itemize}

\hline
\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} & \textbf{Key Feature} \\
\hline

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{5. Revocation of Proposal and Acceptance:}  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section 5 of the Indian Contract Act:} A proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer.
    \item An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is complete as against the acceptor.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples (Proposal or Not?):}  
Below are 20+ situations analyzed to determine if they constitute a proposal:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A says, "I will sell my bike to you for \$500" – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item An advertisement for a sale on TV – \textbf{Not a proposal}, it's an \textit{invitation to offer}.
    \item A menu card in a restaurant – \textbf{Not a proposal}.
    \item Display of goods in a shop with a price tag – \textbf{Not a proposal}.
    \item A says, "Will you buy my car for \$5,000?" – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A tells B, “I may consider selling my house” – \textbf{Not a proposal}.
    \item Public auction notice – \textbf{Invitation to offer}.
    \item A quote or tender submission – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item B submits a bid in auction – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A company issues a prospectus – \textbf{Invitation to offer}.
    \item A person asks, “Can you lend me your book?” – \textbf{Not a legal proposal}.
    \item X offers Y a job with fixed terms – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A general statement: “I wish someone would buy my house” – \textbf{Not a proposal}.
    \item A mails a signed letter offering to sell goods – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A unilateral offer of reward for finding a lost pet – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item Online listing of a laptop on eBay – \textbf{Proposal} (depending on platform rules).
    \item Negotiation discussion: “I might accept \$1000 for this item” – \textbf{Not a proposal}.
    \item A says, “If you pay today, I will give a discount” – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A invitation to tender (e.g., govt contract) – \textbf{Invitation to offer}.
    \item B’s submission of the tender form – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A says “Let’s form a partnership” – \textbf{Proposal}.
    \item A makes a standing offer to supply items – \textbf{Proposal}.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} The difference between \textit{“invitation to offer”} and an actual \textbf{proposal} is crucial. An invitation invites others to make offers, whereas a proposal is the starting point of contractual intent.

\textbf{Conclusion:}  
Understanding the conceptual differences between proposal, promise, and acceptance is crucial in legal and business transactions. Clear communication, intent to be bound, and adherence to legal formalities determine the enforceability of contracts. Revocation rights add further complexity and protection for both parties involved.
